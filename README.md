# An amusing experiment to try on myself

This is a new kind of time. One that is different on every point on earth and different on every day.

The idea is simple.

The sun rises at 6 AM and sets at 6 PM. It does this every day wherever on earth you are.

This is really an experiment to see what a different sense of time means. A second can be shorter or longer depending on the season but you are inextricably linked to the world via the sunrise and sunset.

So right now all this little bit of code does is give me the new time.

But for the time being it only works in Katoomba, Australia.
