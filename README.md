# An amusing experiment to try on myself

This is a new kind of time. One that is different on every point on earth and different on every day.

The idea is simple.

The sun rises at 6 AM and sets at 6 PM. It does this every day wherever you are.

Time runs at a constant speed during daylight hours. It does this at night as well but those speeds are usually not going to be the same.

During summer, time is going to go slower during the day and faster at night.
During winter, time is going to move quickly during the day and slowly at night.

One other nitfy artifact is that midday (12 PM) will  be the time when the sun is at its highest.

This is really an experiment to see what a different sense of time means. A second can be shorter or longer depending on the season but you are inextricably linked to the world via the sunrise and sunset.

So right now all this little bit of code does is give me the new time.

But for the time being it only works in Katoomba, Australia.
